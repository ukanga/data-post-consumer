It is a demonstration of consuming data that is posted as json or xml from the webhook restservice in [Onadata](https://github.com/onaio/onadata).

For the submitted JSON data if it has the key `_id` key, it will be stored in an in-memory database with [TinyDB](https://github.com/msiemens/tinydb) that stores at most 10 records.

$ pip install -r requirements.pip

$ python controller.py

Examples
--------

if you post a json file, you should get as response '{"status": "OK"}'
$ curl -d @json_data.json localhost:8080 -H "Content-Type:application/json"

expected output is: {"status": "OK"}
